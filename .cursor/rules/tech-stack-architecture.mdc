# Tech Stack & Architecture Guidelines

## Primary Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Functions, Hosting)
- **Database**: Firestore with real-time listeners
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth (Email/Password, Google OAuth)
- **Maps**: Google Maps JavaScript API
- **State Management**: React Query/TanStack Query + React Context
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **UI Components**: Radix UI + custom accessible components

## Architecture Principles
1. **Mobile-First**: Design and develop for mobile, enhance for desktop
2. **Accessibility-First**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance throughout
3. **Performance-First**: Optimize for older devices and slow connections
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript
5. **Real-time Data**: Leverage Firestore real-time listeners for live updates

## Firestore Collections Structure
