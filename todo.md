# FeedFind.org TDD Development Todo List

## 🧪 Test-Driven Development Approach

**Philosophy**: Write tests first, then write the minimum code to make them pass. This ensures comprehensive test coverage, better code design, and fewer bugs in production.

**Testing Strategy**:
- **Unit Tests**: Individual functions and components (80% coverage target)
- **Integration Tests**: API interactions and database operations
- **E2E Tests**: Critical user flows and accessibility
- **Visual Regression Tests**: UI consistency across devices

**Tech Stack**:
- **Testing Framework**: Jest + Testing Library
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright
- **Visual Testing**: Chromatic/Percy
- **Accessibility Testing**: axe-core + manual testing

## Testing Best Practices & Standards

### 🧪 TDD Guidelines

#### Test Structure Standards
```typescript
// Use AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Set up common test data and mocks
    jest.clearAllMocks();
  });

  it('should describe expected behavior clearly', async () => {
    // Arrange: Set up test data and mocks
    const mockData = { /* test data */ };
    const mockCallback = jest.fn();
    
    // Act: Execute the function or render component
    render(<Component data={mockData} onCallback={mockCallback} />);
    const button = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /submit/i });
    await userEvent.click(button);
    
    // Assert: Verify expected outcome
    expect(mockCallback).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expectedValue);
    expect(screen.getByText(/success/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

#### Mock Strategy Guidelines
```typescript
// Service layer mocking
jest.mock('../lib/firebase', () => ({
  auth: {
    currentUser: { uid: 'test-user-id' },
    signInWithEmailAndPassword: jest.fn(),
  },
  db: {
    collection: jest.fn(() => ({
      doc: jest.fn(() => ({
        get: jest.fn(() => Promise.resolve({ data: () => mockData })),
      })),
    })),
  },
}));

// Component mocking for complex dependencies
jest.mock('../components/map/LocationMap', () => ({
  LocationMap: ({ locations, onLocationSelect }: any) => (
    <div data-testid="location-map">
      {locations.map((loc: any) => (
        <button key={loc.id} onClick={() => onLocationSelect(loc)}>
          {loc.name}

## Final Implementation Notes

### 🎯 TDD Success Factors

This comprehensive TDD approach ensures that FeedFind.org is built with:

1. **Reliability First**: Every feature backed by comprehensive tests
2. **Accessibility Built-In**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance from day one
3. **Performance Optimized**: Mobile-first design with measurable benchmarks
4. **Security Focused**: Proactive security testing and validation
5. **Maintainable Code**: Well-tested, documented, and refactorable codebase
6. **User-Centered Design**: Real user testing and feedback integration
7. **Scalable Architecture**: Built to handle growth and feature expansion

The test-first approach with 287+ tests provides confidence in every deployment and ensures that the platform serves its critical mission of connecting food-insecure individuals with assistance resources reliably and with dignity.

### 🚀 Next Steps Priority Order

1. **Complete Phase 12**: Security & Error Handling implementation
2. **Execute Phase 13**: Mobile optimization and PWA features
3. **Implement Phase 14**: Analytics and monitoring systems
4. **Finalize Phase 15**: Launch preparation and final testing
5. **Plan Phase 16+**: Post-launch optimization and scaling

This TDD-focused roadmap ensures that FeedFind.org launches as a robust, accessible, and reliable platform that can truly make a difference in communities facing food insecurity.
