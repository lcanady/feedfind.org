## Google AdSense Integration

The platform includes non-obtrusive Google AdSense integration following Craigslist-style design principles:

### Ad Placements
- **Header Ad**: Small horizontal banner below the main header

   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_CLIENT_ID=ca-pub-your-client-id
   ```
3. Update the ad slot IDs in `/components/ui/AdSense.tsx` with your actual ad slots

### Ad Slot Setup
Replace the placeholder ad slots in `components/ui/AdSense.tsx`:
```typescript
// Replace these with your actual ad slot IDs
HeaderAd: adSlot="1234567890"
SidebarAd: adSlot="1234567891"  
FooterAd: adSlot="1234567892"
```

### Features
- **Responsive**: Ads automatically adjust to different screen sizes
